<p>Recently, Google officially launched<span> </span><a href="https://www.android.com/versions/pie-9-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android 9 Pie</a>, which includes a slew of new features around digital well-being, security, and privacy. If you’ve poked around the network settings on your phone while on the beta or after updating, you may have noticed a new<span> </span><a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/04/dns-over-tls-support-in-android-p.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Private DNS Mode</a><span> </span>now supported by Android.</p>
<p>This new feature simplifies the process of configuring a custom secure DNS resolver on Android, meaning parties between your device and the websites you visit won’t be able to snoop on your DNS queries because they’ll be encrypted. The protocol behind this, TLS, is also responsible for the green lock icon you see in your address bar when visiting websites over HTTPS. The same technology is useful for encrypting DNS queries, ensuring they cannot be tampered with and are unintelligible to ISPs, mobile carriers, and any others in the network path between you and your DNS resolver. These new security protocols are called<span> </span><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DNS over HTTPS</a>, and<span> </span><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-tls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DNS over TLS</a>.</p>
<h3 id="configuring1111">Configuring 1.1.1.1</h3>
<p>Android Pie only supports DNS over TLS. To enable this on your device:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Settings → Network &amp; internet → Advanced → Private DNS.</li>
<li>Select the Private DNS provider hostname option.</li>
<li>Enter<span> </span><code>1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com</code><span> </span>and hit Save.</li>
<li>Visit<span> </span><a href="https://1.1.1.1/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.1.1.1/help</a><span> </span>(or<span> </span><a href="https://1.0.0.1/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.0.0.1/help</a>) to verify that “Using DNS over TLS (DoT)” shows as “Yes”.</li>
</ol>
<p>And you’re done!</p>
